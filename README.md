Provider-aware subscription quota status for Pi. It follows the active model and fetches that provider’s quota.

```text
▰▱▱▱  24%  ↻  3:25
```

## Supported providers

| Active model provider | Subscription | Authentication | Quota windows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `openai`, `openai-codex` | OpenAI Codex | Pi `/login openai-codex` | 5 hour, weekly |
| `kimi-coding` | Kimi Coding | Pi `/login kimi-coding` or `KIMI_API_KEY` | 5 hour, weekly |

Unsupported model providers produce no footer status.

## Install

```sh
pi install git:github.com/iurysza/pi-token-tank
```

Then authenticate the provider you use:

```text
/login openai-codex
/login kimi-coding
```

Reload Pi after installation.

## Footer modes

Minimal mode is the default and shows the provider’s primary window:

```text
▰▱▱▱  24%  ↻  3:25
```

Full mode adds the configured secondary window:

```text
5h  ▰▱▱▱  24%  ↻ 3:25   ·   7d  ▰▱▱▱  15%  ↻ Sun 9:00
```

- Four gauge cells represent 25-point usage buckets.
- Percentage colors show urgency: green under 70%, yellow under 90%, red at 90%+.
- `~` after a percentage means the extension is showing stale last-good data.
- Reset timestamps use local time.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/token-tank` | Toggle detailed quota data for every configured provider |
| `/token-tank minimal` | Use the compact footer with the primary quota window |
| `/token-tank full` | Use the bigger footer with every configured quota window |

The details panel also reminds you about `minimal` and `full`, so the larger view is easy to discover.

The selected mode is stored in `pi-token-tank.json` under Pi’s agent directory. The file contains only `{ "footerMode": "minimal" | "full" }`—never credentials or quota data.

## Refresh and failure behavior

- Fetches the active provider on session start.
- Refreshes after turns and model switches when cached data is older than five minutes.
- Routes immediately when the active model changes.
- Opening `/token-tank` forces all registered providers to refresh independently.
- Keeps last-good data and marks it stale if a later request fails.
- Shows `—` when credentials are missing and `!` when a request fails without cached data.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run check
npm test
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Troubleshooting

- `—`: authenticate the active model provider.
- `!`: verify credentials and network access.
- Missing footer segment with a custom footer: the custom `ctx.ui.setFooter()` implementation must render extension statuses. `/token-tank` remains available.
